We will also monitor our progress in the design process by capturing our design escapes (errors) with the Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC). Upon completion of this course the student will be able to: generate systems specifications from a perceived need; partition functionality between hardware and software; produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems; use computer-aided design tools; fabricate, integrate, and debug a hardware/software system; and evaluate the system in the context of an end user application.

This thematic research seminar will explore the workings of Congress - the first branch under the Constitution - and its role in making public policy. It combines coursework with the original scholarship requirements of a UCDC research seminar and is designed particularly for students in Congressional internships and those considering Congressional staff positions after graduation. This seminar will take advantage of our Washington location by featuring frequent guest speakers and seeking connections to current policy and political debate. In addition to studying the pathways of lawmaking, we will ask how Congress and its Members relate to the other branches of government, the press, and the public. Topics to be examined include the rules and organization of Capitol Hill, campaign finance, redistricting, lawmaking and the House and Senate rules, budget process and politics, executive oversight, judicial nominations, lobbyists and influence, and policy entrepreneurialism. Seminar requirements in addition to the internship include preparation and in-class participation, a substantial research brief and several applied writing assignments related to a policy that currently is or should be before Congress.

Washington has, rather surprisingly, emerged as the second most vibrant theatrical city in the nation, surpassing Chicago and Los Angeles in number of performances offered, audience in attendance, and union actors appearing in Equity-contracted productions. The city now boasts some of the finest classical flagship and culturally specific theaters in the country. This advent of a robust theater scene planted in the seat of power has created a unique cultural profile; that of an artistic force able to speak truth to power. Yet oftentimes, theatrical institutions are constricted by the divided nature of the audience they play for, or the critical community that critiques them, or differing notions about the purpose of theater. What kind of portraits are emerging from area theaters in this politicized capital? What are the practical politics within these institutions that seek to engage and entertain their patrons?

Both rule-based and constraint-based approaches to phonology rely on discrete symbols, whether they be phones or features, but the speech stream is not neatly divided into segment-sized units, and the features of phonological theory are typically spread over multiple segments.

The central organizing principle is historical, but there are a number of recurring thematic concerns. These include an examination of the basic principles and terminology of filmmaking, the development of film technology, the definition of film as both art and business, the history of film as an object of critical and cultural study, and the importance of film as the precursor of newer formats. The course has four key goals. First, to provide students with a solid grounding in the key issues and concepts of film studies. Second, to expand their ability to knowledgeably critique individual cinematic works and the relationship of those works to the larger culture.

Spring 2013: Ever since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the technological exhibition in the nineteenth century, there has been a growing presence for science and technology in the lives of everyday citizens. In some cases, these phenomena have sparked the public's imagination and their promise has stirred their confidence in a better future. In other cases, they have kindled fears and generated protests over the risks of new technologies and the threats of novel scientific ideas to prevailing social, cultural, economic, and political orders. This course examines the complex dynamics in the relationships between science, technology, and society. Towards this end it engages with questions such as: How do we decide who an expert is? To what extent do scientists have an obligation to consider the social and ethical consequences of their work? Is public education about science and technology sufficient for addressing social concerns about risk and controversial scientific ideas? We will grapple with these and other questions by exploring modern public debates in which science, technology, and society play a primary role such as the AIDS crisis, global warming, and the autism vaccine debate. With the help of analytical theories from sociology, rhetoric, and public policy, we will develop a general framework for thinking about argument and the dynamics of the relationship between science, technology and the public. In addition, we will look to these fields for tools to assess specific instances of public debate and to complicate and/or affirm the prevailing theories about their relationship.

It interacts with central issues in computer science, artificial intelligence as well as mathematics but also with broader methodological, philosophical questions. This course presents a theory of formal proofs that serve to represent mathematical arguments. We first study proofs in natural deduction and sequent calculi. We show that every proof is reducible to a normal one; normal proofs have an important internal structure and are critical for automated theorem proving and proof search. They are also critical for metamathematical studies that concern, for example, consistency and decidability. We then examine frameworks for the formalization of mathematical practice: starting with arithmetic and ending with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, after having made a detour through Church's simple type theory. As strict formalization is here not just a matter of principle but of real practice, we will discuss interactive theorem proving systems (AProS, Isabelle, Twelf) that can be used for the formal verification of mathematical proofs. Finally, G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem (of 1931) is the starting point for considering an extension of Hilbert's finitist consistency program. (We will establish G\u00f6del's theorem for set theory and arithmetic.) We present, as a paradigm of pre-G\u00f6delian investigations, the consistency proof Hilbert & Bernays gave in 1922 for a quantifier-free part of arithmetic. Then we discuss the G\u00f6del-Gentzen-reduction of classical to intuitionist arithmetic and present Gentzen's 1936 consistency proof of the latter by transfinite induction (up to epsilon-0).

However, they may ignore some remarkable ways literacy is also used by people in non-elite communities to speak and act for themselves. In this introduction to the interdisciplinary study of literacy?its history, theory, and problems?we will first explore competing theories of what literacy allows you to do, how people learn to carry off different literate practices, and what schools should teach. Then we will turn ideas into action in a hands-on, community literacy project, helping urban students use writing to take literate action for themselves. As mentors, we meet on campus for 8 weeks with teenagers from Pittsburgh?s inner city neighborhoods who are working on the challenging transition from school to work. They earn the opportunity to come to CMU as part of Start On Success (SOS), an innovative internship that helps urban teenagers with hidden learning disabilities negotiate the new demands of work or college. We mentor them through Decision Makers (a CMU computer-supported learning project that uses writing as a tool for reflective decision making.) As your SOS Scholar creates a personal Decision Maker?s Journey Book and learns new strategies for writing, planning and decision making, you will see literacy in action and develop your own skills in intercultural collaboration and inquiry.

Information from this course can provide professionals in all industries with tactical advantages in choosing among graphic media options when allocating their media budgets. This course is designed to equip students with a measure of graphic literacy, which refers to the skills and knowledge needed to produce graphic documents that enhance the communication aims of the author. Graphic literacy is an invaluable skill for success in the communication age wherein most professionals are engaged in some aspect of producing graphic documents. Topics of investigation include: traditional printing methods, typography, color reproduction, digital photography, digital cinema, papermaking, electronic paper, graphic displays, inks & coatings, finishing techniques, document security, electrophotographic printing, inkjet printing, large format printing, and holography.

While emphasis is placed on musical instruments, course work will also encompass instruments that produce light, image, movement, etc. This course unfolds in two phases: literature review and individualized projects.

Students will study theoretical and computational frameworks for working with gesture in instrument design. Topics of interest include: gesture data acquisition, data analysis, and mapping gesture data to hybrid-software-hardware computational systems that generate sound/image/movement. We will investigate the software and hardware technologies underlying the design and fabrication of hybrid instruments with electronics, sensors, signal processing, digital fabrication.

Students will explore the significance of the city in the formation of national identities from the 19th through the early 20th century, and then move to more contemporary times, which have seen an explosion of urbanization and the transformation of many cities. At present, Latin America is the most urbanized region in the world, with 80% of its population residing in cities, a figure expected to jump to 90% by 2050. While looking broadly across Spain, Latin America and the US, special consideration will be given to Barcelona, Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Santiago, New York and Los Angeles.", "coreqs": "", "semester": ["F", "S"], "department": "Modern Languages"}, "18320": {"lectures": [{"instructors": ["Paramesh"], "sections": [{"instructors": ["Instructor TBA"], "meetings": [{"location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "09:20PM", "days": "R", "begin": "06:30PM", "room": "HH A104"}, {"location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "12:20PM", "days": "F", "begin": "11:30AM", "room": "WEH 5403"}], "section": "A"}], "meetings": [{"location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "02:20PM", "days": "MW", "begin": "12:30PM", "room": "DH 2122"}], "lecture": "Lec"}], "prereqs": "18-220", "name": "Microelectronic Circuits", "units": 12.0, "desc": "18-320 introduces students to the fundamentals of microelectronic circuits.

The mathematical and computational notions and results are among the most significant contributions of logic, not just to the solution of internal logical questions and to the foundations of computer science, but also to the beginnings of a deeper understanding of the human mind and mental processes.

"Interpretation and Argument", "units": 9.0, "desc": "76-101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own. The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community. Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each student's individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

Consult the course descriptions provided by the department for current offerings Example, Fall 2010: Before the Beat Generation there was the Lost Generation. Both moments of literary history have an important relevance for our time, and both produced many major literary works. The 20's, like the 50's and 60's were marked by the effects of World War. Gertrude Stein seems to have started the whole generation-naming fad with her comment to Hemingway, \"You are all a lost generation.\" Paul Fussell identifies the cultural effect of WWI as the production of \"irony\" as the central quality of modern identity. Of course, the \"lost\" generation wasn't really lost even if it was searching for new ways of understanding experience. And \"beat\" generation wasn't beaten down either. And irony wasn't invented yesterday even if it still is a dominant mode of modern experience. The last generation to have a really significant name, the beat generation was marked in part by an interest in jazz, and an intense interest in the power of writing. Writing was both a form of recording a response (often oppositional, often ecstatic) to what was going on in the world, and it was also a way of re-inventing the world by discovering some kind of previously hidden secret that only \"writing\" could uncover. There is a continuing interest in beat writing these days, days which are usually taken to be characterized by a decline in print literacy accompanied by a growth in force of electronic media. So, amongst other things, reading the Beats offers us an opportunity to explore our own times, as well as to read (or-read) a body of powerful visionary literature from the recent past.

The Aztec empire, however, was only the latest urban civilizations in a Mesoamerican tradition that stretched back more than 2,000 years. The ensuing European architectural and urban imprints can be seen as both a victory of colonialism?s political, social, and architectural ideals, and as a fusion combining European practices with indigenous conditions and traditions. Centuries later, as 20th-century Latin Americans grappled with the challenges of industrialization, economic swings, and political and social revolutions, architects, planners, and clients again sought to reconcile competing visions of national and modern identities.

Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles ?Teenie? Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences.

These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and certain controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larra\u00edn 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. Three main questions will be discussed throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?, How does Latin America think of itself?, What does Latin America want to be?.

FALL 2015: In this course, we will explore U.S. Latino cultures and identities to gain insight into how these diverse populations have influenced and themselves been affected by mainstream U.S. culture. The course will trace the historical trajectories of these groups, both those dating back centuries, such as Mexican-Americans and certain Caribbean populations, and those with more recent, quickly growing populations, such as Salvadoran and Honduran immigrants, or \u00bfCentral-American Americans\u00bf, in an effort to understand how their identities are forged and transformed over time, considering both internal and external perspectives. Students will examine key moments in each group's history, drawing on materials from a variety of disciplines and sources including but not limited to film, literature, oral histories, newspapers articles, as well as theoretical articles that explore questions of identity, to compare and to contrast their diverse experiences. The course will include discussions and debates on the multiple factors that affect U.S. Latino populations, including for example, U.S. immigration policy, political and economic events in Latin America and the U.S. Further, we will consider the interplay of issues such as race, class, gender and sexuality, in the formation of U.S. Latino identities.

The course is not intended just for those who want to become science journalists, but for anyone who may have the need to explain technical information to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearing, a doctor describing the latest research on a disease to a patient advocacy group, or a computer programmer describing new software to his firm's marketing staff. Students will get a chance to read several examples of top-notch science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles - and rewriting them after they've been edited. The articles will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works to explorations of controversies in science. Students should expect to see their writing critiqued in class from time to time, in a process similar to what journalists routinely go through.

Course participants will actively explore collaborative learning instructional practices, learning theory, group dynamics, study strategies, and communication and leadership skills in order to create a supportive learning environment. Teaching practice is an integral part of the training program. Students must complete an application in person or electronically at (http://www.cmu.edu/acadev/studentjobs/index.html) and then be interviewed by the instructor(s) to determine if the student possesses the basic qualifications.

In this course we will examine the often fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which legal discourse is directed to global audiences, particularly the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect ideals of democracy to suit particular geopolitical goals. We will begin by studying the ways in which desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States was influenced by cold war politics, then we will study the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed rulers in emerging democracies have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that the society observes the \"rule of law.\" Alongside primary sources of legal rhetoric, we will study a selection of interdisciplinary scholarship about the relationship of rhetoric and law.

This phenomenon occurred in part because of the development of mass media, including popular books and magazines, movies, and recordings. These media provided both objects with which adolescents identified and hence defined themselves, and representations of the activities of youth to the rest of the population. This course will focus on films which have since the twenties performed these functions. It will pay particular attention to post-W. W. II youth subcultures in the United States and Britain such as the student-radical subculture or punk subculture. We will also look at the representations that the mass media have created of youth: from the \"flaming youth\" of the twenties to the juvenile delinquents of the fifties. While both movies and records are art forms, they are also commodities. They are products of what Adorno calls the \"culture industry.\" In the 1950s, youth becomes a specific market for which a host of special products are created. These include genres of both movies and records, but also clothes, food, toothpaste. etc. While earlier products of large film studios and record companies aimed at the widest possible audience and tended to openly reflect mainstream values, the movies and records designed for teenagers tried explicitly to appeal to the values of a presumed youth subculture. Perhaps as a result\u2014or perhaps for other reasons\u2014some of these materials appear to be subversive of the dominant culture. A major question which this course will try to answer is whether youth culture has in fact been generally, or even occasionally, subversive, or whether it has served mainly to reinforce the dominant ideology.

As we will see, while the Wright brothers successfully invented the airplane, they gave little attention to how it might be used. In negotiating with the US Army in 1907 to sell their plane to the government, the brothers suggested merely that it would be useful in reconnaissance. By the end of World War II, however, the airplane had fundamentally changed the nature of modern warfare, with the US military using airplanes in a much wider variety of roles: offensive, defensive, and support. This course will track these changes and place them in historical context.

One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles \"Teenie\" Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others.

Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalism's glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy. The last segment of the course examines the evolution of journalism in the digital age and the impact that is having on the media landscape, particularly print.

The course begins with the East-West discourse and the creation of stereotypes, Sa\u00efd's theory on Orientalism, being a \"careful reader\" of the literature and media that may create such stereotypes, and how to go beyond them so as to gain a true understanding of the hybrid nature of Arab societies. The course will then discuss the key religious and cultural beliefs and customs, and the challenges that construct Arab thought and relations (family- marriage- sexuality). The selected readings will highlight Arab men and women writers' roles as social critics of the sometimes injustices endured under a dominant patriarchal social system. There will also be an appreciation of Arab artistic creativity (photography, painting, calligraphy). The course material will vary between newspapers and critical articles, novels, films, and documentaries.

The basic topics of uniaxial tension/compression, torsion, and flexural deformation from 24-261 are reviewed. Combined loadings and stresses are then treated, which lead to a consideration of failure criteria. Two-dimensional elasticity and the finite element method are introduced. Stress concentrations are quantified analytically, numerically, and with the use of engineering handbooks. Cyclic failure criteria are introduced, and both static and cyclic failure criteria are applied to results from numerical analysis. 3 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec./lab.
