However, they may ignore some remarkable ways literacy is also used by people in non-elite communities to speak and act for themselves. In this introduction to the interdisciplinary study of literacy?its history, theory, and problems?we will first explore competing theories of what literacy allows you to do, how people learn to carry off different literate practices, and what schools should teach. Then we will turn ideas into action in a hands-on, community literacy project, helping urban students use writing to take literate action for themselves. As mentors, we meet on campus for 8 weeks with teenagers from Pittsburgh?s inner city neighborhoods who are working on the challenging transition from school to work. They earn the opportunity to come to CMU as part of Start On Success (SOS), an innovative internship that helps urban teenagers with hidden learning disabilities negotiate the new demands of work or college. We mentor them through Decision Makers (a CMU computer-supported learning project that uses writing as a tool for reflective decision making.) As your SOS Scholar creates a personal Decision Maker?s Journey Book and learns new strategies for writing, planning and decision making, you will see literacy in action and develop your own skills in intercultural collaboration and inquiry.

This phenomenon occurred in part because of the development of mass media, including popular books and magazines, movies, and recordings. These media provided both objects with which adolescents identified and hence defined themselves, and representations of the activities of youth to the rest of the population. This course will focus on films which have since the twenties performed these functions. It will pay particular attention to post-W. W. II youth subcultures in the United States and Britain such as the student-radical subculture or punk subculture. We will also look at the representations that the mass media have created of youth: from the \"flaming youth\" of the twenties to the juvenile delinquents of the fifties. While both movies and records are art forms, they are also commodities. They are products of what Adorno calls the \"culture industry.\" In the 1950s, youth becomes a specific market for which a host of special products are created. These include genres of both movies and records, but also clothes, food, toothpaste. etc. While earlier products of large film studios and record companies aimed at the widest possible audience and tended to openly reflect mainstream values, the movies and records designed for teenagers tried explicitly to appeal to the values of a presumed youth subculture. Perhaps as a result\u2014or perhaps for other reasons\u2014some of these materials appear to be subversive of the dominant culture. A major question which this course will try to answer is whether youth culture has in fact been generally, or even occasionally, subversive, or whether it has served mainly to reinforce the dominant ideology.

The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.

These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and certain controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larra\u00edn 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. Three main questions will be discussed throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?, How does Latin America think of itself?, What does Latin America want to be?.

Materials do not stand alone in development however, they are a result of, or are influenced by, technological needs and developments. The more advanced the material, the more energy and effort is required for its' production. In the US, the production of materials accounts for about 90% of the country's energy usage. This fact clearly indicates a strong tie between materials and energy, and without energy, technological developments based on material advancement will not occur. In our world today, the need to provide improved performance, economics and design in consumer goods comes as a direct result of the market conditions established by consumers. Material selection and design therefore is driven by application and consumer needs which implies that the consumer has a large influence on material consumption. Material selection and material usage in turn have major ecological implications in energy, material resources and direct environmental impact.

Questions we will consider as well as looking at looking at the current public policy responses to them are: Why are some countries rich and some are poor? Why have some countries experienced rapid economic development; what can be done to foster development of others that continue to languish? Does education lead to increased household wealth and national wealth? How are new technologies affecting economic development and economic opportunities? Can we improve design of electronic markets to take advantage of the vast opportunities for trade and exchange afforded by by the internet?

Spring 2013: Ever since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the technological exhibition in the nineteenth century, there has been a growing presence for science and technology in the lives of everyday citizens. In some cases, these phenomena have sparked the public's imagination and their promise has stirred their confidence in a better future. In other cases, they have kindled fears and generated protests over the risks of new technologies and the threats of novel scientific ideas to prevailing social, cultural, economic, and political orders. This course examines the complex dynamics in the relationships between science, technology, and society. Towards this end it engages with questions such as: How do we decide who an expert is? To what extent do scientists have an obligation to consider the social and ethical consequences of their work? Is public education about science and technology sufficient for addressing social concerns about risk and controversial scientific ideas? We will grapple with these and other questions by exploring modern public debates in which science, technology, and society play a primary role such as the AIDS crisis, global warming, and the autism vaccine debate. With the help of analytical theories from sociology, rhetoric, and public policy, we will develop a general framework for thinking about argument and the dynamics of the relationship between science, technology and the public. In addition, we will look to these fields for tools to assess specific instances of public debate and to complicate and/or affirm the prevailing theories about their relationship.

Throughout the semester students will explore the materials and equipment used by all kinds of professionals in the fabrication industry. Through this exploration students will become conversant with the kinds of properties, and the advantages and disadvantages of many different items. Along with this exploration is a concurrent investigation of entertainment industry accidents. This material is valuable in how it contextualizes the kind of work students will be involved in, and helps to drive home the very real consequences of errors pertaining to scenery. In the classroom and in lab students in this course will develop their knowledge and processes for building scenery. The course has three basic units. The beginning of the semester focuses on building materials and on tool use. Through the center of the semester course material focuses on traditional scenery practices. The end of the semester material addresses rigging systems and scenery rigging practices. Laboratory assignments tied to this course will consist of carpentry assignments in the shop and carpentry and rigging assignments during load in.

As we will see, while the Wright brothers successfully invented the airplane, they gave little attention to how it might be used. In negotiating with the US Army in 1907 to sell their plane to the government, the brothers suggested merely that it would be useful in reconnaissance. By the end of World War II, however, the airplane had fundamentally changed the nature of modern warfare, with the US military using airplanes in a much wider variety of roles: offensive, defensive, and support.

Students in this course will understand the core principles behind CPSs, develop models and controls, identify safety specifications and critical properties of CPSs, understand abstraction and system architectures, learn how to design by invariant, reason rigorously about CPS models, verify CPS models of appropriate scale, understand the semantics of a CPS model and develop an intuition for operational effects. Students will write hybrid programs (HPs), which capture relevant dynamical aspects of CPSs in a simple programming language with a simple semantics, allowing the programmer to refer to real-valued variables representing real quantities and specify their dynamics as part of the HP.

It interacts with central issues in computer science, artificial intelligence as well as mathematics but also with broader methodological, philosophical questions. This course presents a theory of formal proofs that serve to represent mathematical arguments. We first study proofs in natural deduction and sequent calculi. We show that every proof is reducible to a normal one; normal proofs have an important internal structure and are critical for automated theorem proving and proof search. They are also critical for metamathematical studies that concern, for example, consistency and decidability. We then examine frameworks for the formalization of mathematical practice: starting with arithmetic and ending with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, after having made a detour through Church's simple type theory. As strict formalization is here not just a matter of principle but of real practice, we will discuss interactive theorem proving systems (AProS, Isabelle, Twelf) that can be used for the formal verification of mathematical proofs. Finally, G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem (of 1931) is the starting point for considering an extension of Hilbert's finitist consistency program. (We will establish G\u00f6del's theorem for set theory and arithmetic.) We present, as a paradigm of pre-G\u00f6delian investigations, the consistency proof Hilbert & Bernays gave in 1922 for a quantifier-free part of arithmetic. Then we discuss the G\u00f6del-Gentzen-reduction of classical to intuitionist arithmetic and present Gentzen's 1936 consistency proof of the latter by transfinite induction (up to epsilon-0).

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own. The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community. Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity.

For writing majors, the course will increase their understanding of scientific research and how to describe it accurately and completely to a general audience. For science majors, this course will teach them how to craft fluid, powerful prose so that they can bring their disciplines to life. The course is not intended just for those who want to become science journalists, but for anyone who may have the need to explain technical information to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearing, a doctor describing the latest research on a disease to a patient advocacy group, or a computer programmer describing new software to his firm's marketing staff. Students will get a chance to read several examples of top-notch science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles - and rewriting them after they've been edited. The articles will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works to explorations of controversies in science. Students should expect to see their writing critiqued in class from time to time, in a process similar to what journalists routinely go through.

Both moments of literary history have an important relevance for our time, and both produced many major literary works. The 20's, like the 50's and 60's were marked by the effects of World War. Gertrude Stein seems to have started the whole generation-naming fad with her comment to Hemingway, \"You are all a lost generation.\" Paul Fussell identifies the cultural effect of WWI as the production of \"irony\" as the central quality of modern identity. Of course, the \"lost\" generation wasn't really lost even if it was searching for new ways of understanding experience. And \"beat\" generation wasn't beaten down either. And irony wasn't invented yesterday even if it still is a dominant mode of modern experience. The last generation to have a really significant name, the beat generation was marked in part by an interest in jazz, and an intense interest in the power of writing. Writing was both a form of recording a response (often oppositional, often ecstatic) to what was going on in the world, and it was also a way of re-inventing the world by discovering some kind of previously hidden secret that only \"writing\" could uncover. There is a continuing interest in beat writing these days, days which are usually taken to be characterized by a decline in print literacy accompanied by a growth in force of electronic media.

This course will begin exploring these questions historically by theorizing women's relation to the nation in nationalist struggles. We will look specifically at the close connection between women and elements of tradition, including religion. Moving into the contemporary moment, we will examine the experiences of immigrant women and women in the global factory. As a way to interrogate our own assumptions, we will consider heated debates about global feminism. Throughout the course, we will think through the role of cultural representations in these issues. Readings will be drawn from around the world, and include theoretical works as well as literary and filmic representations.

The focus will be on the production and refining of oil, conventional power plants and nuclear power plants. The course will begin with a discussion of the materials used in these applications and this discussion will focus on compositions, heat treatment, microstructure and nominal mechanical properties after heat treatment. The materials will include low alloy steels, stainless steels, nickel base alloys and zirconium alloys used as fuel cladding in nuclear reactors. The mechanical behavior discussed will be the behavior of materials at high temperatures, various types of stress corrosion cracking and the toughness of steels used at low temperatures. In addition, various forms of embrittlement associated with long service times at elevated temperatures will be discussed. These will include hydrogen attack, temper embrittlement due to segregation of impurities and alloying elements, the formation of phases which result in embrittlement and embrittlement due to irradiation in nuclear reactors. Many of these materials are expected to be in service for many years so, where time permits, methodologies used to predict mechanical properties after long times in service will be discussed."}}, "fces": []}
